This module provides a command-line interface for managing and generating code summaries for a project.
- It uses `commander` for CLI argument parsing.
- Defines three main commands:
    - `get-summary <filePath>`: Retrieves or generates a summary for a single file. If the file is outside the current project, it generates a transient summary without saving it.
    - `save-summary <filePath>`: Reads or generates a summary for a single file and ensures it's saved within the project's summary storage.
    - `sync`: Synchronizes all summaries in the project. It identifies stale summaries (or all if `force` option is used) and regenerates them. It also removes any "orphan" summaries that no longer correspond to existing source files. This command includes a confirmation prompt for large numbers of files to manage potential LLM costs and reports token usage.
- Utilizes `glob` for file system traversal and `p-limit` to control the concurrency of summary generation (which often involves external LLM calls).
- Interacts with core summarization logic, file system layout utilities, and configuration loading.

This file directly interacts with:
- `../index.js`: Imports `readOrGenerateSummary`, `isStale`, and `generateTransientSummary`.
- `../fs/layout.js`: Imports `getSourcePath`.
- `../config.js`: Imports `loadConfig`.
