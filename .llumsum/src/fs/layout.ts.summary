This module defines functions for mapping between source file paths and their corresponding summary file paths within a project's `.llumsum` directory.
- Exports `getSummaryPath(projectRoot, sourcePath)` which takes a project root and a source file path, and returns the path to its associated summary file in the `.llumsum` directory.
- Exports `getSourcePath(projectRoot, summaryPath)` which performs the reverse operation, taking a project root and a summary file path, and returning the original source file path.
- Primarily used internally by other modules that need to locate or create summary files.
- Relies on the Node.js `path` module for path manipulation.
