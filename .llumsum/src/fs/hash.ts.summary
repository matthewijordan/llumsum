This module provides a utility for calculating the SHA-1 hash of a given file.
- Exports a single asynchronous function, `getFileHash(filePath)`, which takes a file path and returns a Promise that resolves with the hexadecimal SHA-1 hash of the file's content.
- It uses Node.js's built-in `crypto` and `fs` modules to create a readable stream from the file and pipe its data through a SHA-1 hasher.
- This is useful for file integrity checks or as part of a caching mechanism.
