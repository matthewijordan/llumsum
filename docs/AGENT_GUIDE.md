You are interacting with a codebase that utilizes a specialized summarization system. This system maintains high-level summaries of source code files within a hidden directory named `.llumsum/` located at the project root.

**Purpose of .llumsum files:**
The `.llumsum/` directory mirrors the project's source code structure. Inside, you will find `.summary` files corresponding to source files (e.g., `my-project/src/main.ts` will have a summary at `my-project/.llumsum/src/main.ts.summary`). These summaries are designed to:
- Provide a concise, natural language overview of a file's purpose, exports, and key interactions.
- Help you quickly understand file relevance and content without needing to ingest the full source code.
- Overcome context window limitations by providing pre-digested information.

**Structure of a .summary file:**
Each `.summary` file is a plain text file with two main parts:
1.  **First Line:** Contains a content hash of the original source file (e.g., `hash: <sha1_hash_value>`). This is metadata for the summarization system.
2.  **Body:** A free-form natural language summary generated by an LLM. This summary describes:
    *   The high-level purpose of the file.
    *   Key functions, classes, or constants exported or defined, and their roles.
    *   Important workflows or side effects.
    *   Crucially, it identifies and lists other project files this file directly interacts with (e.g., imports, uses functions/classes from, or modifies data in).

**How to use .llumsum files:**
1.  **Locate Summary:** For a given source file (e.g., `path/to/your/file.js`), its summary will be at `.llumsum/path/to/your/file.js.summary`.
2.  **Utilize Summary Content:** Read the natural language body of the `.summary` file. **Assume the summary is up-to-date with the source file.** Use this information to understand the file's role, its API surface, and its dependencies on other project files. This allows for more efficient navigation, planning, and code understanding without full file ingestion.

**Example Usage Flow for an AI Agent:**
- When considering a source file `src/auth/user.js`:
    - Read `src/auth/user.js.summary`.
    - Read the summary body. Note that it mentions interactions with `src/utils/crypto.js` and `src/db/users.js`.
    - Use this knowledge to prioritize further investigation or to understand the `user.js` file's role in the broader system.
